Ruby Waves

Taken from 7/14/2019  -

The run down portion just goes down the D major scale starting from a B. 
I'm not entirely positive if he plays thirds under each note or not, 
but either way you can play just the root of each of those or both. 
Or try something else like fifths or octaves! Trey plays it differently every time it seems.

Listen for strum pattern/timing

A
Blue morning, walking down the street
G                        D
Hear the rhythm from the soles of my feet
A
On the pavement, and I reach out my hands
G                             D
And touch the building that's beside me
      A
And I look into the air up above my head
G                           D
Thin layer of clouds and the open sky
A
All the stars are handles on doors
          G
If I could touch 'em with my fingers
            D
They would open up


A                                         G               D
And a sea of love, ruby waves would pour down on my head
A
An ocean of love would carry me
G                       D
Up from this prison of lies
A
If I could touch the stars with my fingertip
     G                           D
The doors would open all around me
      A                                    G
Could escape from this prison of lies and swim
                 D
In the ocean up above my head


Repeat intro


A                          G             D
When I die I'll turn into a tiny ball of energy
A                                                 G     D
And I'll go flipping and floating up into the sky
A
And bounce off the stars like a pinball machine
G              D
Look around
A
All the lights on the machine are flashing
G                            D
'Til they explode and the particles join up with


A                                         G               D
a sea of love, ruby waves would pour down on my head
A
An ocean of love would carry me
G                       D
Up from this prison of lies
A
If I could touch the stars with my fingertip
     G                           D
The doors would open all around me

A
Could escape from this prison of lies
Could escape from this prison of lies

Into epic jam


Chord shapes I see Trey using in the Youtube video. 
At times it also seems like he lets the high e string stay open in these chords - especially in the chorus
You Can also play an A (5) on the high e for the A chord throughout as well. As with most things it seems like he swithches it up
